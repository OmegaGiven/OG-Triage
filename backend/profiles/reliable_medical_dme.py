"""
CompanyProfile for Reliable Medical -- a fictional national complex rehab
technology (CRT) / durable medical equipment (DME) provider. This is the
second portfolio company added in Phase 4, to prove the pipeline built for
Comprehensive EyeCare Partners generalizes rather than being eye-care-only.

What genuinely differs from the CEP profile, and why:
  - Extraction schema: DME claims are billed under HCPCS Level II codes
    (not CPT), so `hcpcs_code`/`hcpcs_description` replace `cpt_code`/
    `cpt_description`. Two fields are DME-specific and have no CEP
    equivalent:
      - `equipment_type` -- what class of equipment the claim is for (e.g.
        "power wheelchair", "CPAP device", "ankle-foot orthosis"). Useful
        both for the model's own reasoning and for downstream reporting.
      - `lmn_reference_number` -- a Letter of Medical Necessity is a real,
        DME-specific document requirement: Medicare and most commercial
        payers require a physician-signed LMN (or a CMS-847-style
        Certificate of Medical Necessity for certain item categories)
        establishing medical necessity for DME/CRT equipment before the
        claim will be paid, which eye-care procedure claims have no
        equivalent of. Optional field (like `prior_auth_number`) -- only
        populated if the letter actually cites one.
  - Category guide (classify.py) and appeal guidance (draft_appeal.py) are
    reframed around DME/CRT specifics: HCPCS Level II codes and DME
    modifiers (NU/RR/UE/KX) instead of CPT modifiers, LMN/CMN
    documentation instead of clinical chart notes, and Medicare DME MAC
    LCDs instead of generic payer LCDs for medical-necessity arguments.
  - The six CLASSIFICATION_CATEGORIES themselves are unchanged from
    CEP -- they are genuine root-cause buckets for any healthcare claim
    denial, not eye-care-specific, so there was nothing to invent there.

CARC codes below are the same real, X12-maintained codes used in the CEP
profile (verified against x12.org/codes -- see the WebFetch verification
in this phase's work) -- CARCs are generic across specialties, not
eye-care- or DME-specific, so reusing the verified numbers is correct, not
lazy. Only the *typical* set per category and the RARC pairings are
adjusted where DME claims genuinely differ (e.g. CARC 197
precertification-absent is far more common for DME than for routine
eye-care office visits, since Medicare requires prior authorization for
certain power mobility devices and other DME categories).

CATEGORY_GUIDE = """
- coding_error: a billing/coding problem with the claim as submitted --
  invalid HCPCS code, missing or incorrect DME modifier (e.g. NU for new
  equipment, RR for rental, UE for used, KX for documentation-on-file
  attestation), or mismatched HCPCS/ICD-10 combination. Typical CARCs: 4,
  11, 16 (when paired with a coding-specific RARC), 97, 234.
- missing_information: the payer needs additional information or
  documentation to adjudicate the claim -- most commonly a missing Letter
  of Medical Necessity (LMN) or Certificate of Medical Necessity (CMN),
  missing physician order/prescription, or incomplete claim data. Typical
  CARCs: 16 (paired with an informational RARC requesting documentation),
  197 (precertification/authorization absent -- common for DME since many
  payers, including Medicare, require prior authorization for certain
  power mobility devices and other equipment categories), 252.
- medical_necessity: the payer determined the equipment was not medically
  necessary, or the LMN/clinical documentation on file does not support the
  level of equipment billed (e.g. a power wheelchair denied where the
  documentation only supports a manual wheelchair or cane). Typical CARCs:
  50, 149, 167.
- timely_filing: the claim was submitted after the payer's filing deadline.
  Typical CARC: 29.
- eligibility: the patient was not eligible or covered on the date of
  service, or the equipment/item is not a covered benefit under the plan.
  Typical CARCs: 26, 27, 31, 96.
- duplicate_claim: the payer identified this claim as a duplicate of one
  already processed -- e.g. billed twice for the same equipment delivery,
  or billed as a purchase after an identical rental claim, rather than a
  distinct replacement/repair/upgrade. Typical CARC: 18.
