CompanyProfile: the config-per-company abstraction that drives the pipeline.

Phase 2 built extract.py/classify.py/draft_appeal.py hardcoded for a single
company (Comprehensive EyeCare Partners). Phase 4 pulls everything that was
company-specific -- the extraction tool schema, the system prompts for all
three stages, and the appeal-drafting guidance -- out into a CompanyProfile,
keyed off denials.source_company, so the SAME pipeline code drives multiple
portfolio companies' claim types.

What stays fixed across every profile (not part of this class, deliberately):
  - The six CLASSIFICATION_CATEGORIES in db/models.py. These are genuinely
    universal denial root-causes across healthcare claims (coding, missing
    info, medical necessity, timely filing, eligibility, duplicate) -- a new
    profile should not invent new categories, only adjust the CARC-code
    guide and appeal guidance text that helps the model apply the existing
    six to its own claim type.
  - The classification tool's JSON schema (category enum + confidence +
    reasoning) -- classify.py keeps this as one shared, generic tool
    definition. Only the system-prompt framing and CARC-code guide vary per
    profile.
  - The retry/token-accounting/DB-write plumbing in common.py and each
    stage's *.py -- none of that is company-specific.

What genuinely varies per profile, and is captured below:
  - The extraction tool schema (different structured fields per claim type,
    e.g. cpt_code vs. hcpcs_code, and profile-specific optional fields like
    a DME Letter-of-Medical-Necessity reference number).
  - Each stage's system-prompt text (company name/domain framing, and for
    classification, a category guide with claim-type-appropriate CARC/RARC
    examples).
  - Appeal-drafting guidance per category, and the appeal system prompt's
    template (which fields it instructs the model to cite, and what
    domain-specific documentation to reference, e.g. an LMN for DME
    missing_information denials).
