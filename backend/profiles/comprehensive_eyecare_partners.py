- coding_error: a billing/coding problem with the claim as submitted --

  with a coding-specific RARC), 97, 234.
- missing_information: the payer needs additional information or
  documentation to adjudicate the claim -- missing records, missing referral,
  incomplete claim data. Typical CARCs: 16 (paired with an informational
  RARC requesting documentation), 252.
- medical_necessity: the payer determined the service was not medically
  necessary, or lacks clinical documentation to support necessity. Typical
  CARCs: 50, 149, 167.
- timely_filing: the claim was submitted after the payer's filing deadline.
  Typical CARC: 29.
- eligibility: the patient was not eligible or covered on the date of
  service, or the service is not a covered benefit under the plan. Typical
  CARCs: 26, 27, 31, 96.
- duplicate_claim: the payer identified this claim as a duplicate of one
  already processed. Typical CARC: 18.
