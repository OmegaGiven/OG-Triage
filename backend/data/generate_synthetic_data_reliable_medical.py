"""
Generates synthetic claim-denial letters for "Reliable Medical" (a fictional
national complex rehab technology / durable medical equipment provider) --
the Phase 4 second-company dataset, proving the pipeline built for
Comprehensive EyeCare Partners (see generate_synthetic_data.py) generalizes
to a genuinely different claim type rather than being eye-care-only.

Design notes (same approach as generate_synthetic_data.py, deliberately):
- Deterministic: a fixed random seed makes output reproducible across runs.
- Data-driven: letters are assembled from pools of payers, physicians,
  equipment, diagnoses, and sentence fragments, with randomized selection
  per letter, so output reads as varied prose rather than mail-merged
  template text with blanks filled in.
- CARC/RARC codes used below are real, current X12-maintained codes. They
  are the SAME verified codes used in generate_synthetic_data.py's
  CATEGORIES (CARCs are generic across specialties, not eye-care- or
  DME-specific) -- re-verified against x12.org/codes for this phase via a
  live WebFetch of x12.org/codes/claim-adjustment-reason-codes and
  x12.org/codes/remittance-advice-remark-codes. One RARC that came up in a
  preliminary search (M127, "missing medical record") was checked and
  DROPPED because x12.org currently lists it as "Reserved for future
  use" -- not a usable code.
- HCPCS Level II equipment codes are real, current codes (verified via web
  search against AAPC/Palmetto GBA DMECS/CMS coding references): K0823
  (power wheelchair, group 2 standard), E1130 (wheelchair, standard),
  E0601 (CPAP device), E0470 (bi-level respiratory assist device, no
  backup rate), E0260 (semi-electric hospital bed), L1960 (custom-fabricated
  ankle-foot orthosis), L5856 (microprocessor-controlled knee-shin system,
  lower-limb prosthesis addition).
- No real people, patients, payers, or PHI of any kind. All names, payers,
  NPIs, member IDs, and claim numbers are synthetic and clearly fabricated.
