"""
Generates synthetic claim-denial letters for "Comprehensive EyeCare Partners"
(a fictional ophthalmology MSO) plus a labeled evaluation subset.

Design notes
------------
- Deterministic: a fixed random seed makes output reproducible across runs.
- Data-driven: letters are assembled from pools of payers, clinicians,
  procedures, diagnoses, and sentence fragments -- not hardcoded as static
  strings -- but sentence selection/order/style is randomized per letter so
  the output reads as varied natural prose rather than mail-merged template
  text with blanks filled in.
- CARC/RARC codes used below are real, current X12-maintained codes, verified
  against x12.org/codes (see the comment above each CATEGORY entry). They are
  not invented.
- No real people, patients, payers, or PHI of any kind. All names, payers,
  NPIs, member IDs, and claim numbers are synthetic and clearly fabricated.

Usage
-----
    python generate_synthetic_data.py

Writes (relative to this file's directory):
    denials_synthetic.json   -- full synthetic dataset (45-50 denials)
    eval_labeled.json        -- labeled subset for regression testing
